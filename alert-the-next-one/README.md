# Alert the next one

In a doctor's office, passwords are distributed among patients. When the doctor calls a patient by the password number, he alerts the next one to stay in the chair near the door. Now he wants you to help him through this process.

## Input

The input consists of several test cases. Each case contains an integer value N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000), representing the password that was called at that time.

## Output

For each test case, print the password for the next one to be alerted.
